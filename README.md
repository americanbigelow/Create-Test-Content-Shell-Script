# createtestcontent.sh

This is a script to aid in an online demonstration I'm doing. Basically, it creates a directory containing 10 subdirectories. These in turn contain 5 randomly named text files that have lines of random random words. This is useful for teaching or practicing basic bash skills like cd, ls, find, grep, cp, mv, chmod, etc.
